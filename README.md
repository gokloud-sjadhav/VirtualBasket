# VirtualBasket

A virtual basket is a common e-commerce feature. Users can add several items to the basket and later pay for all the items at once. Promotional discounts are sometimes available as part of virtual baskets. When certain items or combinations of items are purchased at the same time a discount is applied. Correctly calculating the total price of the items in a basket, including discounts, is important. That is required for displaying the right amount to pay to customers as well as ensuring that the right amount is charged.
